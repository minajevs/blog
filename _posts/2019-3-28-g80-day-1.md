In the beginning of 2019 I got old used g81-1800 case in my hands. This beautiful board was probably scraped for OG Cherry doubleshots by some other enthusiast, and the case was dismissed as cheap and unwanted. I kinda enjoy old Cherry boards, especially 1800 ones, so I decided to try to give this case another chance. 

I received it 28.03 and this is the day when my journey starts!

## Day 1 - Cleaning 
This case was fairly used before and it is not in pristine condition, so the first thing I need to do is to clean it. 

### Before

### After

There were black marks adn streaks on the back of the board. Those look like it hit against another plastic piece. On the front there were dark spots, probably from eaten-in gunk, sweat and dirt. It can't be seen on those photos, but there were also black spots on the corners, probably because it was handled poorly. 

First of all I cleaned all the dust with hot water and a sponge. Then, to remove all the residue gunk I used denatured alcohol, then soapy sponge and fine amounts of water. Black marks could not be removed with normal sponge and any cleaning substance I had. I tried abrasive side of the sponge on the inside of the case and it left microscratches on plastic, so I decided not to use it. I then remembered I have melamine sponge lying around, so tried it and succeeded. Melamine sponge is abrasive as well, however has much finer grain and does not scratch plastic, at least visibly. This sponge removed all remaining spots and streaks, however some streaks left dents in plastic, which melamine sponge can't help with. 

Overall case is in a very good shape. It has some signs of wear, such as dents and streaks, however looking from the top none is really noticeable. Plastic has yellowed/grayed a little, so retr0brighting might be a next step.

## Next Steps
This a very beginning of the project. There are many things to do left. Out of my head what I expect to do:
* Whiten the case (retr0bright)
* Get a plate for switches (TKC v2?)
* Engrave plate?
* Get a PCB for switches (TKC v2?)
* Get black switches. (Black linears, either vintage in the best case, or retooled black.)
* Modify switches. Lube, sticker. Colorful tops to make it more fun inside?
* Get keycaps. GMK Minimal incoming, however bright-white might not work with  yellowed case. Let's see..

I will be posting progress here, however more glam pictures will go to my instagram and facebook. Finished project will be posted on rmk, gh and deskthority.

Peace.
