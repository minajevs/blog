title: Accessing IIS Express from LAN
---

Today I encountered the need of debugging a web app from external server (located in our companies LAN). The problem is that the Web App is running under local IIS Express, and it should be requested from outer world.

Well, I am actually surprised it doesn't work "from the box".
